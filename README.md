User and key management with ansible
===

This is an example of how to manage users and their ~/.ssh/authorized_keys across multiple servers using ansible.  It was my
first attempt at any ansible playbook and can likely be done a lot better/smarter.  Feel free to submit a patch if you see any
bad practices here.
